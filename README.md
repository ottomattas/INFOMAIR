# Methods in AI Research

# [Part 1a: data and domain modelling](https://uu.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3274643_1&course_id=_122545_1)
* Task description and datasets are available on [UU Blackboard](https://uu.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3274643_1&course_id=_122545_1);
* We used 51 sessions (*from voip-0a45bc863d-20130325_200321 to voip-3b81cbb287-20130326_031000*) in the **dstc2_test/Mar13_S2A0** dataset to model the transition diagram;
* Python code was created based on the task description.

## Deliverables
The zip container holds both the transition diagram and the python program.
We delivered **Team18_1a.zip** with successful results, while feedback with improvements was received during the practice session on 17/09/2019.  The latest version of the zip container was not delivered for review as this was done locally during the practice session.


# [Part 1b: text classification](https://uu.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3274643_1&course_id=_122545_1).
* Task description and datasets are available on [UU Blackboard](https://uu.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3274643_1&course_id=_122545_1)
* We used the dstc2_traindev dataset to create the baselines.
* Python code was created based on the task description.

## Baseline systems
1) We parsed all the acts and created files with the output to describe the turns in appropriately named files (e.g **1b/baseline_data/ack**);
2) After we had the turns separated, we parsed all the transcriptions for creating the ruleset for every act (e.g **1b/baseline_data/ack.t**);
3) We created the baseline rules manually in **1b/baseline_rules**.
